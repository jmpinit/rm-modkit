# ReMarkable Modkit

A [ReMarkable](https://remarkable.com/) e-reader / drawing tablet runs Linux and can be SSHed into and customized. Modifications outside of **/root** are generally overwritten by system updates.

Clone this directory into **/root** on your ReMarkable, add your images to the **images** directory, and run **mod.sh**. Any time a system update occurs re-run mod.sh to reinstall your modifications.
